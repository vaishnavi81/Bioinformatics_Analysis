Summary of Workflow:

#Download and Rename Fastq Files

Download two sets of paired-end fastq files from SRA using prefetch and fastq-dump.

Rename them as sample1_R1.fq, sample1_R2.fq, sample2_R1.fq, and sample2_R2.fq.

#Downsampling (if needed)

Use seqkit to subset the fastq files if they are too large.

#Calculate Fastq Statistics

Use seqkit stats to calculate total reads and total bases for each fastq file and store the results in a text file.

#Quality Control (QC) and Trimming

Perform QC checks using tools like FastQC.
Trim the sequences if required based on the QC results.

#Download and Index Reference Genome

Download the human genome fasta file from UCSC (hg38) and index it using BWA (bwa index).

#Alignment

Align the paired-end fastq files using bwa mem and save the output in SAM format.

#Convert SAM to BAM and Sort

Convert SAM files to BAM using samtools view, then sort and index the BAM files with samtools sort and samtools index.

#Calculate Alignment Statistics

Use samtools flagstat and samtools stats to generate alignment statistics for each BAM file.

#Mark Duplicates

Mark duplicates using samtools markdup and generate statistics.

#Variant Calling (GATK)

Prepare the reference genome with gatk CreateSequenceDictionary and samtools faidx.
Use GATK's HaplotypeCaller for variant calling and output in GVCF format.

#Read Group Addition

Add or replace read groups using GATK (AddOrReplaceReadGroups) for both samples.

#Filter and Separate Variants

Separate SNPs and indels using awk and store them in separate VCF files.

#Comparative Analysis of Variants

Identify common variants (SNPs and indels) between the two samples using awk scripts and store the results in VCF files.

#Variant Annotation

Annotate variants using an open-source tool (e.g., SnpEff or VEP).
